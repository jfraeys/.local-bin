# .local-bin Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `.local-bin` repository. This collection is designed to enhance and customize your development environment. Here's a quick overview of the key components:

## Binary Files

- **aactivator.py:** A powerful script designed to automate the sourcing of environments in an interactive shell. Activate it effortlessly by evaluating `$(aactivator init)` in your shell.
- **tmux_sessionizer:** This script simplifies the management of tmux sessions by providing an interactive interface to create or switch between sessions. If a session doesn't exist for a selected directory, it creates a new tmux session with the selected directory as the working directory.
- **tmux_windownizer:** This script is designed to streamline the process of sending commands to a specific tmux window. It takes a branch name (or any identifier) as an argument, creates a new window if it doesn't exist in the current tmux session, and sends the provided command to that window.
- **update_brew_lists:** This script automates the process of updating Homebrew and associated package lists. It can be used to keep track of installed packages and update them as needed.

Feel free to use these scripts to simplify tasks and enhance your development workflow.
